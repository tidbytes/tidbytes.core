# Tidbit

A Clojure framework intending to closely integrate an S-expression inspired
template language for serving web sites in a small and extensible web server.

## Usage

Not much yet. The server works in so far that it responds with legal HTTP
responses, but that is it.

## License

We haven't quite decided yet. You are absolutely free to use our code, however.
